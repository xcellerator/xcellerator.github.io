      <description>One of the functions that that Yubikey can provide is the option to &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo; a static password on the token which will be &amp;ldquo;typed&amp;rdquo; out on the host whenever you press the button. Having already done quite of a lot of work on the USB HID implementation, I was curious to know how Yubico had decided to emulate the keyboard functionality. Ultimately, I was hoping that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to set all kinds of different modifiers like Ctrl+Alt+Del and Super+R to have a little more fun with it (BadUSB/Rubber Ducky style).</description>
