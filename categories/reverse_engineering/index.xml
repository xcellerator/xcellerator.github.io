      <description>You can find the git repo with the finished submission here: BootNoodle
 A few days ago (as of writing), @netspooky announced the first (hopefully annual!) Binary Golf Grand Prix on Twitter. The objective was to create a binary of any sort that is the same forwards as it is byte-reversed, but with an emphasis on creating as small a binary as possible, hence golfing.
This was one of those challenges where I thought that I had no chance of even creating a qualifying submission, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to just wait for the results and admire the work of everyone else.</description>

      <description>One of the functions that that Yubikey can provide is the option to &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo; a static password on the token which will be &amp;ldquo;typed&amp;rdquo; out on the host whenever you press the button. Having already done quite of a lot of work on the USB HID implementation, I was curious to know how Yubico had decided to emulate the keyboard functionality. Ultimately, I was hoping that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to set all kinds of different modifiers like Ctrl+Alt+Del and Super+R to have a little more fun with it (BadUSB/Rubber Ducky style).</description>
