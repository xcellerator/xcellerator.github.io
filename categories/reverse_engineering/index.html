      Introduction It’s that time of year again - the Binary Golf Grand Prix is back for a third year running! You can also check out my entries to the first and second times this amazing competition ran.
The theme this year was to produce a binary that crashes a given program. Bonus points for hijacking execution, and submitting a patch to the project that fixes the vulnerability. Coinciding with the announcement of this year’s competition, @netspooky told me about a little-known accessory for the GameBoy/GameBoy Colour/GameBoy Advance called the Mobile Adapter GB, which let players connect their console to the internet via their mobile phone.

      This year, @netspooky announced another round of the Binary Golf Grand Prix. If you missed it last year, the challenge was to create a palindromic binary - you can see the writeup of my entry, BootNoodle, here. This time around, the theme was polyglots, i.e. the challenge was to create a binary (as small as possible - hence the Golf part…) that was simulateously another filetype.
The rules were laid out very clearly into 2 categories: first - the smallest file that satisfied all the rules wins; second - rack up points by overlapping more and more filetypes with the bytes of your host binary.

      A few days ago, Google’s research team published an information leak vulnerability in the Linux bluetooth stack along with a very nice poc.
In this post, I want to go through and dissect this poc to identify exactly what the vulnerability is and how it’s been fixed. This is the first kernel vulnerability that I’ve dove into deeply and I’ve found it to be surprisingly simple and straightforward.
The vulnerability itself, dubbed Bleeding Tooth by Google, is able to leak values from the kernel’s stack memory.

      You can find the git repo with the finished submission here: BootNoodle
A few days ago (as of writing), @netspooky announced the first (hopefully annual!) Binary Golf Grand Prix on Twitter. The objective was to create a binary of any sort that is the same forwards as it is byte-reversed, but with an emphasis on creating as small a binary as possible, hence golfing.
This was one of those challenges where I thought that I had no chance of even creating a qualifying submission, so it’s better to just wait for the results and admire the work of everyone else.

      One of the functions that that Yubikey can provide is the option to “store” a static password on the token which will be “typed” out on the host whenever you press the button. Having already done quite of a lot of work on the USB HID implementation, I was curious to know how Yubico had decided to emulate the keyboard functionality. Ultimately, I was hoping that I’d be able to set all kinds of different modifiers like Ctrl+Alt+Del and Super+R to have a little more fun with it (BadUSB/Rubber Ducky style).
